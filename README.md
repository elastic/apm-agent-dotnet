## Repository structure

These are the main folders within the repository:
* src: The source code of the agent. Each project within this folder targets a specific library, and there is one core project, which is referenced by all other projects.
    * `Elastic.Apm`: The core project targeting .NET Standard 2.0. It contains the [Agent API](/docs/public-api.asciidoc), the infrastructure to report data to the APM Server, the logging infrastructure, and auto-instrumentation for things that are part of .NET Standard 2.0.
    * `Elastic.Apm.AspNetCore`: Auto-instrumentation for ASP.NET Core.
    * `Elastic.Apm.EntityFrameworkCore`: Auto-instrumentation for EntityFramework Core.
    * `Elastic.Apm.NetCoreAll`: A convenient project that references all other .NET Core related projects from the `src` folder. It contains an ASP.NET Core middleware extension that enables the agent and every other component with a single line of code. In a typical ASP.NET Core application (e.g. apps referencing [Microsoft.AspNetCore.All](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.All)) that uses EF Core the `Elastic.Apm.NetCoreAll` can be referenced.
    * `Elastic.Apm.AspNetFullFramework`: Auto-instrumentation for ASP.NET (classic).
    * `Elastic.Apm.EntityFramework6`: Auto-instrumentation for Entity Framework 6.
* test: This folder contains test projects. Typically each project from the `src` folder has a corresponding test project.
    * `Elastic.Apm.Tests`: Tests the `Elastic.Apm` project.
    * `Elastic.Apm.AspNetCore.Tests`: Tests the `Elastic.Apm.AspNetCore` project.
    * `Elastic.Apm.AspNetFullFramework.Tests`: Tests the `Elastic.Apm.AspNetFullFramework` project.
    * `Elastic.Apm.Tests.MockApmServer`: Implementation of APM Server mock used for agent-as-component tests (for example in `Elastic.Apm.AspNetFullFramework.Tests`).
* docs: This folder contains the official documentation.
* sample: Sample applications that are monitored by the APM .NET Agent. These are also very useful for development: you can start one of these applications and debug the agent through them.
* .ci: This folder contains all the scripts used to build, test and release the agent within the CI.
