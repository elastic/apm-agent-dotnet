- Auto instrumentation automatically creates sub-spans in case a span is already active {pull}391[#391]

===== Breaking changes

We have some breaking changes in this release. We wanted to do these changes prior to our GA release and with this we hopefully avoid breaking changes in the upcoming versions.

- For better naming we replaced the `Elastic.Apm.All` packages with `Elastic.Apm.NetCoreAll`  {pull}371[#371]
- Based on feedback we also renamed the `UseElasticApm()` method in the `Elastic.Apm.NetCoreAll` package to `UseAllElasticApm` - this method turns on every component of the Agent for ASP.NET Core. {pull}371[#371]
- Our logger abstraction, specifically the `IApmLogger` interface changed: {pull}389[#389]
- To follow the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/index.html[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)], we renamed our `Tags` properties to `Labels`. {pull}416[#416]

[[release-notes-preview1]]
==== Preview release 1

[float]
===== Features

- ASP.NET Core auto instrumentation
- Entity Framework Core auto instrumentation
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient?view=netstandard-2.0[HttpClient] auto instrumentation

- <<public-api,Public Agent API>>

We shipped the following packages:

- Elastic.Apm.All: This is a meta package that references every other Elastic APM .NET agent package. If you plan to monitor a typical ASP.NET Core application that depends on the https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.All[Microsoft.AspNetCore.All] package and uses Entity Framework Core then you should reference this package.
In order to avoid adding unnecessary dependencies in applications that aren’t depending on the https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.All[Microsoft.AspNetCore.All] package we also shipped some other packages - those are all referenced by the Elastic.Apm.All package.

- Elastic.Apm: This is the core of the agent, which we didn’t name “Core”, because someone already took that name :) This package also contains the Public Agent API and it is a .NET Standard 2.0 package. We also ship every tracing component that traces things that are part of .NET Standard 2.0 in this package, which includes the monitoring part for HttpClient.
Elastic.Apm.AspNetCore: This package contains ASP.NET Core monitoring related code. The main difference between this package and the Elastic.Apm.All package is that this package does not reference the

- Elastic.Apm.EntityFrameworkCore package, so if you have an ASP.NET Core application that does not use EF Core and you want to avoid adding additional unused references, you should use this package.

- Elastic.Apm.EntityFrameworkCore: This package contains EF Core monitoring related code.
