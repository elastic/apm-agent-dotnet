# Releasing a new version

This guide aims to provide guidance on how to release new versions of the `apm-agent-dotnet` binary as well as updating all the necessary parts to make it successful.

## Prerequisites

Releasing a new version of the binary implies that there have been changes in the source code which are meant to be released for wider consumption. Before releasing a new version there's some prerequisites that have to be checked.

### Versioning

Versioning off the binaries is automated through [minver](https://github.com/adamralph/minver)

The tag dictates the version number. Untagged commits are automatically versioned as prereleases according to their distance to their closest version tag.

### Generating a changelog for the new version

Prior to tagging and releasing the new version we create a changelog commit. Adding relevant new features and bugfixes to [`CHANGELOG.asciidoc`](CHANGELOG.asciidoc). The idea is to fill all the applicable sections so that users can consume an orderly changelog.

After a changelog has been manually curated, a new pull request must be opened with the changelog.

For instance, the changelog that was created for the 1.2 release can be found in this https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-dotnet/pull/640

## Releasing a new package

In case you release a package the first time and you rely on the CI to push that to nuget.org, you need to make sure that t [deploy.sh](https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-dotnet/blob/main/.ci/linux/deploy.sh) script is updated. You need to add the name of the new package into that script.

## Executing the release

After the new changelog has been merged to main.

Create a new release on Github, creating a new tag for the version `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

Creating a release will trigger the [release Github Action](.github/workflows/release.yml)

## Steps after the release 

### Attaching files on GitHub

We attach 2 files to the release on GitHub:
- `ElasticApmAgent_<major>.<minor>.<bug>(-<suffix>)?.zip`: This is the startup-hook based agent.
- `elastic_apm_profiler_<major>.<minor>.<bug>(-<suffix>)?.zip`: This is the profiler-based agent. The CI currently generates 2 profiler zip files, one for Windows (with `libelastic_apm_profiler.dll`), and one for Linux (with `libelastic_apm_profiler.so`). The only difference in the zip files is the native agent, the remaining files are the same. We copy the 2 native files into a folder with the remaining files and zip that folder as `elastic_apm_profiler_<major>.<minor>.<bug>(-<suffix>)?.zip` which we attach to the release.

The steps above aren't currently automated. All the necessary files can be found under "Artifacts" in Jenkins and the files need to be manually attached to the release on GitHub.

### Updating the documentation

Each major version has a `<major>.x` branch in the repository (e.g. for major version `1` we have the branch `1.x`).

In case of minor and patch releases we just need to update the `<major>.x` branch to the currently released tag:

 ```bash
git checkout v<major>.<minor>.<bug>(-<suffix>)? -b <major>.x

git push --force  upstream
 ```

In case of a major release, we need to create the `<major>.x` branch from the currently released tag and push the new `<major>.x` branch.

Additionally, in case of a major version release, we need to create a PR in [elastic/docs](https://github.com/elastic/docs).

In this PR we need to update:
- [`conf.yaml`](https://github.com/elastic/docs/blob/master/conf.yaml): Set the `current` part to the new `<major>.x` and add that to the `branches` and `live` parts. In addition, remove the previous major entry from the `live` key.
- [`shared/versions/stack/*.asciidoc`](https://github.com/elastic/docs/tree/master/shared/versions/stack): This directory defines how links from stack-versioned documentation relate to links from non stack-versioned documentation. For example, in the `8.5` file, the variable `:apm-dotnet-branch:` is set to `1.x`. This means any links in the `8.5` stack docs (like the APM Guide) that point to the APM .NET Agent reference, will point to the `1.x` version of those docs. The number of files you update in this directory depends on version compatibility between stack docs and your APM agent. In general, we update as far back as the new version of the agent is compatible with the stack; this pushes new documentation to the user.

## Executing the release script locally

If required then it's possible to run the release script locally, for such, the credentials are needed to push to the NuGet repo.

```bash
./build.sh pack
.ci/linux/deploy.sh <API_KEY> <SERVER_URL>
```

_NOTE_ The above scripts are just wrapper for the `dotnet` command.
