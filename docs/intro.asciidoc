[[intro]]

== Introduction

WARNING: **This project is currently a prototype.
Use it at your own risk.**

Welcome to the APM .NET Agent documentation.

Elastic APM automatically measures the performance of your application and tracks errors.
For example, it records spans for database queries and transactions for incoming HTTP requests.

Spans are grouped in transactions - by default one for each incoming HTTP request.
But it's possible to create custom transactions not associated with an HTTP request.

By default the agent comes with support for ASP.NET Core out-of-the-box.
To instrument other events, you can use custom spans.
