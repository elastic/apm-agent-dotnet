# Elasticsearch [setup-elasticsearch]


## Quick start [_quick_start_7]

Instrumentation can be enabled for Elasticsearch when using the official Elasticsearch clients, Elasticsearch.Net and Nest, by referencing [`Elastic.Apm.Elasticsearch`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Elastic.Apm.Elasticsearch) package and passing `ElasticsearchDiagnosticsSubscriber` to the `AddElasticApm` method in case of ASP.NET Core as following

```csharp
app.Services.AddElasticApm(new ElasticsearchDiagnosticsSubscriber());
```

or passing `ElasticsearchDiagnosticsSubscriber` to the `Subscribe` method

```csharp
Agent.Subscribe(new ElasticsearchDiagnosticsSubscriber());
```

Instrumentation listens for activities raised by `Elasticsearch.Net` and `Nest` 7.6.0+, creating spans for executed requests.

::::{important}
If youâ€™re using `Elasticsearch.Net` and `Nest` 7.10.1 or 7.11.0, upgrade to at least 7.11.1 which fixes a bug in span capturing.
