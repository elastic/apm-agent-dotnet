# Other .NET applications [setup-general]

If you have a .NET application that is not covered in this section, you can still use the agent and instrument your application manually.

To do this, add the [Elastic.Apm](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Elastic.Apm) package to your application and use the [*Public API*](/reference/public-api.md) to manually create spans and transactions.
