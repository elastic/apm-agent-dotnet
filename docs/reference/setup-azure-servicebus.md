# Azure Service Bus [setup-azure-servicebus]


## Quick start [_quick_start_12]

Instrumentation can be enabled for Azure Service Bus by referencing [`Elastic.Apm.Azure.ServiceBus`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Elastic.Apm.Azure.ServiceBus) package and subscribing to diagnostic events using one of the subscribers:

1. If the agent is included by referencing the `Elastic.Apm.NetCoreAll` package, the subscribers will be automatically subscribed with the agent, and no further action is required.
2. If you’re using `Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus`, subscribe `MicrosoftAzureServiceBusDiagnosticsSubscriber` with the agent

    ```csharp
    Agent.Subscribe(new MicrosoftAzureServiceBusDiagnosticsSubscriber());
    ```

3. If you’re using `Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus`, subscribe `AzureMessagingServiceBusDiagnosticsSubscriber` with the agent

    ```csharp
    Agent.Subscribe(new AzureMessagingServiceBusDiagnosticsSubscriber());
    ```
