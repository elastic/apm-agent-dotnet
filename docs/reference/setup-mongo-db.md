# MongoDB [setup-mongo-db]


## Quick start [_quick_start_14]

Instrumentation for MongoDB works with the official MongoDb.Driver 2.4.4+ driver packages. A prerequisite for auto instrumentation is to configure the `MongoClient` with `MongoDbEventSubscriber`:

```csharp
var settings = MongoClientSettings.FromConnectionString(mongoConnectionString);

settings.ClusterConfigurator = builder => builder.Subscribe(new MongoDbEventSubscriber());
var mongoClient = new MongoClient(settings);
```

Once the above configuration is in place

* if the agent is included by referencing the `Elastic.Apm.NetCoreAll` package, it will automatically capture calls to MongoDB on every active transaction, and no further action is required.
* you can manually activate auto instrumentation from the `Elastic.Apm.MongoDb` package by calling

```csharp
Agent.Subscribe(new MongoDbDiagnosticsSubscriber());
```

::::{important}
MongoDB integration is currently supported on .NET Core and newer. Due to MongoDb.Driver assemblies not being strongly named, they cannot be used with Elastic APMâ€™s strongly named assemblies on .NET Framework.
