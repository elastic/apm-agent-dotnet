# gRPC [setup-grpc]


## Quick start [_quick_start_8]

Automatic instrumentation for gRPC can be enabled for both client-side and server-side gRPC calls.

Automatic instrumentation for ASP.NET Core server-side is built in to [NuGet package](/reference/setup-asp-net-core.md)

Automatic instrumentation can be enabled for the client-side by referencing [`Elastic.Apm.GrpcClient`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Elastic.Apm.GrpcClient) package and passing `GrpcClientDiagnosticListener` to the `AddElasticApm` method in case of ASP.NET Core

```csharp
app.Services.AddElasticApm(new GrpcClientDiagnosticListener());
```

or passing `GrpcClientDiagnosticSubscriber` to the `Subscribe` method

```csharp
Agent.Subscribe(new GrpcClientDiagnosticSubscriber());
```

Diagnostic events from `Grpc.Net.Client` are captured as spans.
