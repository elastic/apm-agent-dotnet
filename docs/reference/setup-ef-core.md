# Entity Framework Core [setup-ef-core]


## Quick start [_quick_start_5]

Instrumentation can be enabled for Entity Framework Core by referencing [`Elastic.Apm.EntityFrameworkCore`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Elastic.Apm.EntityFrameworkCore) package and passing `EfCoreDiagnosticsSubscriber` to the `AddElasticApm` method in case of ASP.NET Core as following

```csharp
app.Services.AddElasticApm(new EfCoreDiagnosticsSubscriber());
```

or passing `EfCoreDiagnosticsSubscriber` to the `Subscribe` method

```csharp
Agent.Subscribe(new EfCoreDiagnosticsSubscriber());
```

Instrumentation listens for diagnostic events raised by `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` 2.x+, creating database spans for executed commands.
