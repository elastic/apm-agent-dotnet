=== Profiler Auto instrumentation

[float]
==== Quick start

The agent can automatically instrument .NET Framework, .NET Core, and .NET applications using the .NET CLR Profiling API.
The Profiling APIs provide a way to instrument an application or dependency code without code changes.

This approach works with the following

|===
| 2.+^|**Operating system**
|Architecture |Windows |Linux
|x64 
|.NET Framework 4.6.1+

.NET Core 2.1+

.NET 5

|.NET Core 2.1+

.NET 5
|===

and instruments the following assemblies

include::integrations.asciidoc[]

Note that NuGet package versions do not necessarily align with the version of assemblies contained therein. 
https://nuget.info/packages[NuGet package explorer] can be used to inspect the assembly version of assemblies within a NuGet package.

[IMPORTANT]
--
The .NET CLR Profiling API allows only one profiler to be attached to a .NET process. In light of this limitation, only one
solution that uses the .NET CLR profiling API should be used by an application.

Auto instrumentation using the .NET CLR Profiling API can be used in conjunction with 

* the <<public-api, Public API>> to perform manual instrumentation. 
* NuGet packages that perform instrumentation using a `IDiagnosticsSubscriber` to subscribe to diagnostic events.

The version number of NuGet packages referenced by a project instrumented with a profiler 
must be the same as the version number of profiler zip file used.
--

Steps:

. Download the `elastic-apm-dotnet-auto-instrumentation-<version>.zip` file from the https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-dotnet/releases[Releases] page of the .NET APM Agent GitHub repository, where `<version>` is the version number to download. You can find the file under Assets.
. Unzip the zip file into a folder on the host that is hosting the application to instrument.
. Configure the following environment variables
+
.{dot}NET Framework
[source,sh]
----
set COR_ENABLE_PROFILING = "1"
set COR_PROFILER = "{FA65FE15-F085-4681-9B20-95E04F6C03CC}"
set COR_PROFILER_PATH = "<unzipped directory>\elastic_apm_profiler.dll" <1>
set ELASTIC_APM_PROFILER_HOME = "<unzipped directory>"
set ELASTIC_APM_PROFILER_INTEGRATIONS = "<unzipped directory>\integrations.yml"
----
<1> `<unzipped directory>` is the directory to which the zip file
was unzipped in step 2.
+
.{dot}NET Core / .NET 5 on Windows
[source,sh]
----
set CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING = "1"
set CORECLR_PROFILER = "{FA65FE15-F085-4681-9B20-95E04F6C03CC}"
set CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH = "<unzipped directory>\elastic_apm_profiler.dll" <1>
set ELASTIC_APM_PROFILER_HOME = "<unzipped directory>"
set ELASTIC_APM_PROFILER_INTEGRATIONS = "<unzipped directory>\integrations.yml"
----
<1> `<unzipped directory>` is the directory to which the zip file
was unzipped in step 2.
+
.{dot}NET Core / .NET 5 on Linux
[source,sh]
----
export CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1
export CORECLR_PROFILER={FA65FE15-F085-4681-9B20-95E04F6C03CC}
export CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH="<unzipped directory>/libelastic_apm_profiler.so" <1>
export ELASTIC_APM_PROFILER_HOME="<unzipped directory>"
export ELASTIC_APM_PROFILER_INTEGRATIONS="<unzipped directory>/integrations.yml"
----
<1> `<unzipped directory>` is the directory to which the zip file
was unzipped in step 2.
. Start your application in a context where the set environment variables are visible.

With this setup, the .NET runtime loads Elastic's CLR profiler into the .NET process, which loads and instantiates the APM agent early 
in application startup. The profiler monitors methods of interest and injects code to instrument their execution.

=== Instrumenting containers and services

Using global environment variables causes the Elastic profiler auto instrumentation to be loaded for **any** .NET process started on the
host. Often, the environment variables should be set only for specific services or containers. The following sections demonstrate how to configure common containers and services.

[float]
==== Docker containers

A build image containing the files for profiler auto instrumentation
can be used as part of a https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/[multi-stage build]

[source,sh]
----
ARG AGENT_VERSION=1.11.1

FROM alpine:latest AS build
ARG AGENT_VERSION
WORKDIR /source

# install unzip
RUN apt-get -y update && apt-get -yq install unzip

# pull down the zip file based on ${AGENT_VERSION} ARG and unzip
RUN curl -L -o ElasticApmAgent_${AGENT_VERSION}.zip https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-dotnet/releases/download/${AGENT_VERSION}/elastic-apm-dotnet-auto-instrumentation-${AGENT_VERSION}.zip && \ 
    unzip elastic-apm-dotnet-auto-instrumentation-${AGENT_VERSION}.zip -d /elastic-apm-dotnet-auto-instrumentation-${AGENT_VERSION}

----

The files can then be copied into a subsequent stage

[source,sh]
----
COPY --from=build /elastic-apm-dotnet-auto-instrumentation-${AGENT_VERSION} /elastic-apm-dotnet-auto-instrumentation
----

Environment variables can be added to a Dockerfile to configure profiler auto instrumentation

[source,sh]
----
ENV CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1
ENV CORECLR_PROFILER={FA65FE15-F085-4681-9B20-95E04F6C03CC}
ENV CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH=/elastic-apm-dotnet-auto-instrumentation/libelastic_apm_profiler.so
ENV ELASTIC_APM_PROFILER_HOME=/elastic-apm-dotnet-auto-instrumentation
ENV ELASTIC_APM_PROFILER_INTEGRATIONS=/elastic-apm-dotnet-auto-instrumentation/integrations.yml

ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "your-application.dll"]
----

[float]
==== Windows services

Environment variables can be added to specific Windows services by
adding an entry to the Windows registry. Using PowerShell

.{dot}NET Framework service
[source,powershell]
----
$environment = [string[]]@(
  "COR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1", 
  "COR_PROFILER={FA65FE15-F085-4681-9B20-95E04F6C03CC}",
  "COR_PROFILER_PATH=<unzipped directory>\elastic_apm_profiler.dll",
  "ELASTIC_APM_PROFILER_HOME=<unzipped directory>",
  "ELASTIC_APM_PROFILER_INTEGRATIONS=<unzipped directory>\integrations.yml")

Set-ItemProperty HKLM:SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<service-name> -Name Environment -Value $environment
----

.{dot}NET Core service
[source,powershell]
----
$environment = [string[]]@(
  "CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1", 
  "CORECLR_PROFILER={FA65FE15-F085-4681-9B20-95E04F6C03CC}",
  "CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH=<unzipped directory>\elastic_apm_profiler.dll", <1>
  "ELASTIC_APM_PROFILER_HOME=<unzipped directory>",
  "ELASTIC_APM_PROFILER_INTEGRATIONS=<unzipped directory>\integrations.yml")

Set-ItemProperty HKLM:SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<service-name> -Name Environment -Value $environment <2>
----
<1> `<unzipped directory>` is the directory to which the zip file
was unzipped
<2> `<service-name>` is the name of the Windows service.

With PowerShell

[source,powershell]
----
Restart-Service <service-name>
----

[float]
==== Internet Information Services (IIS)

For IIS versions _before_ IIS 10, it is **not** possible to set environment variables scoped to a specific application pool, so environment variables
need to set globally.

For IIS 10 _onwards_, environment variables can be set for an application
pool using https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/get-started/getting-started-with-iis/getting-started-with-appcmdexe[AppCmd.exe]. With PowerShell

.{dot}NET Framework
[source,powershell]
----
$appcmd = "$($env:systemroot)\system32\inetsrv\AppCmd.exe"
$appPool = "<application-pool>" <1>
$environment = @{
  COR_ENABLE_PROFILING = "1"
  COR_PROFILER = "{FA65FE15-F085-4681-9B20-95E04F6C03CC}"
  COR_PROFILER_PATH = "<unzipped directory>\elastic_apm_profiler.dll" <2>
  ELASTIC_APM_PROFILER_HOME = "<unzipped directory>"
  ELASTIC_APM_PROFILER_INTEGRATIONS = "<unzipped directory>\integrations.yml"
  COMPlus_LoaderOptimization = "1" <3>
}

$environment.Keys | ForEach-Object {
  & $appcmd set config -section:system.applicationHost/applicationPools /+"[name='$appPool'].environmentVariables.[name='$_',value='$($environment[$_])']"  
}
----
<1> `<application-pool>` is the name of the Application Pool your application uses
<2> `<unzipped directory>` is the directory to which the zip file
was unzipped
<3> Forces assemblies **not** to be loaded domain-neutral. There is currently a limitation
where Profiler auto-instrumentation cannot instrument assemblies when they are loaded
domain-neutral. This limitation is expected to be removed in future, but for now, can be worked
around by setting this environment variable. See the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/app-domains/application-domains#the-complus_loaderoptimization-environment-variable[Microsoft documentation for further details].

.{dot}NET Core
[source,powershell]
----
$appcmd = "$($env:systemroot)\system32\inetsrv\AppCmd.exe"
$appPool = "<application-pool>" <1>
$environment = @{
  CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING = "1"
  CORECLR_PROFILER = "{FA65FE15-F085-4681-9B20-95E04F6C03CC}"
  CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH = "<unzipped directory>\elastic_apm_profiler.dll" <2>
  ELASTIC_APM_PROFILER_HOME = "<unzipped directory>"
  ELASTIC_APM_PROFILER_INTEGRATIONS = "<unzipped directory>\integrations.yml"
}

$environment.Keys | ForEach-Object {
  & $appcmd set config -section:system.applicationHost/applicationPools /+"[name='$appPool'].environmentVariables.[name='$_',value='$($environment[$_])']"  
}
----
<1> `<application-pool>` is the name of the Application Pool your application uses
<2> `<unzipped directory>` is the directory to which the zip file
was unzipped

[IMPORTANT]
--
Ensure that the location of the `<unzipped directory>` is accessible and executable to the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/manage/configuring-security/application-pool-identities[Identity
account under which the Application Pool runs].
--

Once environment variables have been set, stop and start IIS so that applications hosted in
IIS will see the new environment variables

[source,sh]
----
net stop /y was
net start w3svc
----

[float]
==== systemd / systemctl

Environment variables can be added to specific services run with systemd
by creating an environment.env file containing the following

[source,sh]
----
CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1
CORECLR_PROFILER={FA65FE15-F085-4681-9B20-95E04F6C03CC}
CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH=/elastic-apm-dotnet-auto-instrumentation/libelastic_apm_profiler.so
ELASTIC_APM_PROFILER_HOME=/elastic-apm-dotnet-auto-instrumentation
ELASTIC_APM_PROFILER_INTEGRATIONS=/elastic-apm-dotnet-auto-instrumentation/integrations.yml
----

Then adding an https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html#Command%20lines[`EnvironmentFile`] entry to the service's configuration file
that references the path to the environment.env file

[source,sh]
----
[Service]
EnvironmentFile=/path/to/environment.env
ExecStart=<command> <1>
----
<1> the command that starts your service

After adding the `EnvironmentFile` entry, restart the service

[source,sh]
----
systemctl reload-or-restart <service>
----

[float]
=== Profiler environment variables

The profiler auto instrumentation has its own set of environment variables to manage
the instrumentation

`ELASTIC_APM_PROFILER_HOME`::

The home directory of the profiler auto instrumentation.

`ELASTIC_APM_PROFILER_INTEGRATIONS` _(optional)_::

The path to the integrations.yml file that determines which methods to target for
auto instrumentation. If not specified, the profiler will assume an
integrations.yml exists in the home directory specified by `ELASTIC_APM_PROFILER_HOME`
environment variable.

`ELASTIC_APM_PROFILER_EXCLUDE_INTEGRATIONS` _(optional)_::

A semi-colon separated list of integrations to exclude from auto-instrumentation.
Valid values are those defined in the `Integration` column in the integrations
table above.

`ELASTIC_APM_PROFILER_EXCLUDE_PROCESSES` _(optional)_::

A semi-colon separated list of process names to exclude from auto-instrumentation.
For example, `dotnet.exe;powershell.exe`. Can be used in scenarios where profiler
environment variables have a global scope that would end up auto-instrumenting
applications that should not be.

`ELASTIC_APM_PROFILER_EXCLUDE_SERVICE_NAMES` _(optional)_::

A semi-colon separated list of APM service names to exclude from auto-instrumentation.
Values defined are checked against the value of `ELASTIC_APM_SERVICE_NAME` environment
variable.

`ELASTIC_APM_PROFILER_LOG` _(optional)_::

The log level at which the profiler should log. Valid values are

* trace
* debug
* info
* warn
* error
* none

The default value is `warn`. More verbose log levels like `trace` and `debug` can
affect the runtime performance of profiler auto instrumentation, so are recommended
_only_ for diagnostics purposes.

`ELASTIC_APM_PROFILER_LOG_DIR` _(optional)_::

The directory in which to write profiler log files. If unset, defaults to

* `%PROGRAMDATA%\elastic\apm-agent-dotnet\logs` on Windows
* `/var/log/elastic/apm-agent-dotnet` on Linux

If the default directory cannot be written to for some reason, the profiler
will try to write log files to a `logs` directory in the home directory specified 
by `ELASTIC_APM_PROFILER_HOME` environment variable.
