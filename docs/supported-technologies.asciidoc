== Supported technologies

If your favorite technology is not supported yet,
you can vote for it by participating in our
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/18SgsVo9asGNFMjRqwdrk3wTHNwPhtHv4jE35hZRCL6A/[survey].
We will use the results to add support for the most requested technologies.

Another option is to add a dependency to the agent's <<public-api, public API>>
in order to programmatically create custom transactions and spans.

If you want to extend the auto-instrumentation capabilities of the agent,
the https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-dotnet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md[contributing guide] should get you started.

NOTE: If, for example,
the HTTP client library of your choice is not listed,
it means that there won't be spans for those outgoing HTTP requests.
If the web framework you are using is not supported,
the agent will not capture transactions.

[[supported-dotnet-flavors]]
=== .NET versions

The agent works on every .NET flavor and version that supports .NET Standard 2.0.
This means .NET Core 2.0 (or newer) and .NET Framework 4.6.1 (or newer).

[[supported-web-frameworks]]
=== Web frameworks

Automatic instrumentation for a web framework means
a transaction is automatically created for each incoming request and it is named after the registered route.

We support automatic instrumentation for the following web frameworks.

|===
|Framework |Supported versions |Supported since agent's version

|ASP.NET Core
|2.x
|1.0

|ASP.NET (.NET Framework) on IIS
|4.6.1 or newer (IIS 7.0 or newer)
|1.1

[[supported-networking-client-side-technologies]]
=== Networking client-side technologies

Automatic instrumentation for networking client-side technology means
an HTTP span is automatically created for each outgoing HTTP request and tracing headers are propagated. 
The spans are named after the schema `<method> <host>`, for example `GET elastic.co`.

|===
|Framework |Supported versions |Supported since agent's version

|System.Net.Http.HttpClient on .NET Core
