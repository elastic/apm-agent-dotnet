== Set up the Agent

The .NET agent can be added to an application in three different ways

NuGet packages::
The agent ships as a set of <<packages, NuGet packages>> available on https://nuget.org[nuget.org].
You can add the Agent and specific instrumentations to a .NET application by 
referencing one or more of these packages and following the package documentation.

Profiler runtime instrumentation::
The agent supports auto instrumentation without any code change and without
any recompilation of your projects. See <<setup-auto-instrumentation>>.

Host startup hook::
On **.NET Core 3.0+**, the agent supports auto instrumentation without any code change and without
any recompilation of your projects. See <<zero-code-change-setup, Zero code change setup on .NET Core>>
for more details.

=== Other .NET applications

If you have a .NET application that is not covered in this section, you can still use the agent and instrument your application manually.

To do this, add the {nuget}/Elastic.Apm[Elastic.Apm] package to your application and use the <<public-api>> to manually create spans and transactions.
