[[troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting

Use the information in this section to troubleshoot common problems and find
answers for frequently asked questions.
As a first step, ensure your stack is compatible with the Agent's <<supported-technologies,supported technologies>>.

Don't worry if you can't figure out what the problem is; we’re here to help.
If you are an existing Elastic customer with a support contract, please create a ticket in the
https://support.elastic.co/customers/s/login/[Elastic Support portal].
If not, post in the https://discuss.elastic.co/c/apm[APM discuss forum].

IMPORTANT: *Please attach your debug logs* so that we can analyze the problem.
Upload the *complete* logs to a service like https://gist.github.com.
The logs should include everything from the application startup up until the first request has been executed.

[[no-data-sent]]
=== No data is sent to the APM Server

If neither errors nor performance metrics are being sent to the APM Server,
it's a good idea to first check your logs and look for output just as the app starts.

If you don't see anything suspicious in the agent logs (no warning or error), it's recommended to turn the log level to `Trace` for further investigation.

[float]
[[collect-agent-logs]]
=== Collecting agent logs

The way to collect logs depends on the setup of your application.

[float]
[[collect-logs-core]]
==== ASP.NET Core

If you added the agent to your application as per the <<setup-asp-net-core>> document with the `UseAllElasticApm` or `UseElasticApm` method, it will integrate with the
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging[ASP.NET Core logging infrastructure].
This means the Agent will pick up the configured logging provider and log as any other component logs.

[IMPORTANT]
--
In this scenario, the `LogLevel` APM agent configuration (e.g. setting the `ELASTIC_APM_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable) DOES NOT control the 
verbosity of the agent logs. The agent logs are controlled by the ASP.NET Core logging configuration from `IConfiguration`, typically configured 
via `appsettings.json`.
--

For example, the following configuration in `appsettings.json` limits APM agents logs to those with a log level of `Warning` or higher:

[source,xml]
----
"Logging": {
  "LogLevel": {
    "Default": "Information",
    "Elastic.Apm": "Warning" <1>
  }
},
----
<1> Control the verbosity of the agent logs by setting the log level for the `Elastic.Apm` category

[float]
[[collect-logs-classic]]
==== ASP.NET Classic

ASP.NET (classic) does not have a predefined logging system. By default, the agent is configured to
emit log messages to a 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.tracesource[`System.Diagnostics.TraceSource`] 
with the source name `"Elastic.Apm"`. The TraceSource adheres to the log levels defined in the
APM agent configuration. Typically, you will configure a preferred log level using an application setting in `web.config`.

[IMPORTANT]
--
System.Diagnostics.TraceSource requires the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/debug-trace-profile/how-to-compile-conditionally-with-trace-and-debug[`TRACE` compiler directive to be specified], which is specified
by default for both Debug and Release build configurations.
--

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.tracelistener[TraceListeners]
can be configured to monitor log messages for the trace source, using the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/trace-debug/system-diagnostics-element[`<system.diagnostics>`] section of
web.config. For example, the following web.config section writes Elastic.Apm log messages to a file
named my_log_file.log:

[source,xml]
----
<configuration>
  <!-- other sections .... -->
  <system.diagnostics>
  <sources>
    <source name="Elastic.Apm"> <1>
      <listeners>
        <add name="file" 
          type="System.Diagnostics.TextWriterTraceListener" 
          initializeData="my_log_file.log" />
      </listeners>
    </source>
  </sources>
</system.diagnostics>
</configuration>  
----
<1> Define listeners under a source with name `"Elastic.Apm"` to capture agent logs

[float]
[[collect-logs-class-other-logging-systems]]
===== Other logging systems

If you have a logging system in place such as https://nlog-project.org/[NLog], https://serilog.net/[Serilog], 
or similar, you can direct the agent logs into your logging system by creating an adapter between 
the agent's internal logger and your logging system.

First implement the `IApmLogger` interface from the `Elastic.Apm.Logging` namespace:

[source,csharp]
----
internal class ApmLoggerAdapter : IApmLogger
{
	private readonly Lazy<Logger> _logger;
	public bool IsEnabled(ApmLogLevel level)
	{
		// Check for log level here.
		// Typically you just compare the configured log level of your logger
		// to the input parameter of this method and return if it's the same/higher or not
	}

	public void Log<TState>(ApmLogLevel apmLogLevel, TState state, Exception e, Func<TState, Exception, string> formatter)
	{
		// You can log the given log into your logging system here.
	}
}
----

An example implementation for NLog can be seen https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-dotnet/blob/f6a33a185675b7b918af59d3333d94b32329a84a/sample/AspNetFullFrameworkSampleApp/App_Start/ApmLoggerToNLog.cs[in our GitHub repository].

Then tell the agent to use the `ApmLoggerAdapter`. For ASP.NET (classic), place the following code into the `Application_Start` 
method in the `HttpApplication` implementation of your app which is typically in the `Global.asax.cs` file:

[source,csharp]
----
using Elastic.Apm.AspNetFullFramework;

namespace MyApp
{
	public class MyApplication : HttpApplication
	{
		protected void Application_Start()
		{
			AgentDependencies.Logger = new ApmLoggerAdapter();

			// other application setup...
		}
	}
}
----

During initialization, the agent checks if an additional logger was configured-- the agent only does this once, so it's important 
to set it as early in the process as possible, typically in the `Application_Start` method.

[float]
[[collect-logs-general]]
==== General .NET applications

If none of the above cases apply to your application, you can still use a logger adapter and redirect agent logs into a .NET 
logging system like NLog, Serilog, or similar.

For this you'll need an `IApmLogger` implementation (see above) which you need to pass to the `Setup` method during agent setup:

[source,csharp]
----
Agent.Setup(new AgentComponents(logger: new ApmLoggerAdapter()));
----

[float]
[[double-agent-initialization-log]]
=== Following error appears in logs: `The singleton APM agent has already been instantiated and can no longer be configured.`

See "<<double-agent-initialization>>".

[float]
[[double-agent-initialization]]
=== An `InstanceAlreadyCreatedException` exception is thrown

In the early stage of a monitored process, the Agent might throw an `InstanceAlreadyCreatedException` exception with the following message: "The singleton APM agent has already been instantiated and can no longer be configured.", or an error log appears with the same message. This happens when you attempt to initialize the Agent multiple times, which is prohibited. Allowing multiple Agent instances per process would open up problems, like capturing events and metrics multiple times for each instance, or having multiple background threads for event serialization and transfer to the APM Server.

TIP: Take a look at the initialization section of the <<public-api,Public Agent API>> for more information on how agent initialization works.

As an example, this issue can happen if you call the `Elastic.Apm.Agent.Setup` method multiple times, or if you call another method on `Elastic.Apm.Agent` that implicitly initializes the agent, and then you call the `Elastic.Apm.Agent.Setup` method on the already initialized agent.

Another example might be when you use the Public Agent API in combination with the IIS module or the ASP.NET Core NuGet package, where you enable the agent with the `UseElasticApm` or `UseAllElasticApm` methods. Both the first call to the IIS module and the `UseElasticApm`/`UseAllElasticApm` methods internally call the `Elastic.Apm.Agent.Setup` method to initialize the agent.

You may use the Public Agent API with the `Elastic.Apm.Agent` class in code that can potentially execute before the IIS module initializes or the `UseElasticApm`/`UseAllElasticApm` calls execute. If that happens, those will fail, as the Agent has been implicitly initialized already.

To prevent the `InstanceAlreadyCreatedException` in these scenarios, first use the `Elastic.Apm.Agent.IsConfigured` method to check if the agent is already initialized. After the check, you can safely use other methods in the Public Agent API. This will prevent accidental implicit agent initialization.

[float]
[[legacy-asp-net-sync-context]]
=== ASP.NET is using LegacyAspNetSynchronizationContext and might not behave well for asynchronous code

If you see this warning being logged it means your classic ASP.NET Application is running under quirks mode and is using a deprecated but backwards compatible asynchronous context.
This may prevent our agent from working correctly when asynchronous code introduces a thread switch since this context does not reliably restore `HttpContext.Items`. 

To break out of quirks mode the runtime must be explicitly specified in web.config:


[source,xml]
----
<httpRuntime targetFramework="4.5" />
----

Read more about ASP.NET quirks mode here: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/all-about-httpruntime-targetframework

[float]
[[sql-failed-to-remove-from-processing-spans]]
=== SqlEventListener Failed capturing sql statement (failed to remove from ProcessingSpans).

We log this warning when our SQL even listener is unable to find the active transaction. 
This has been only observed under IIS when the application is running under quirks mode.
See "<<legacy-asp-net-sync-context>>" section for more backfround information and possible fixes.


[float]
[[http-no-transaction]]
=== HttpDiagnosticListenerFullFrameworkImpl No current transaction, skip creating span for outgoing HTTP request

We log this trace warning when our outgoing HTTP listener is not able to get the current transaction.
This has been only observed under IIS when the application is running under quirks mode.
See "<<legacy-asp-net-sync-context>>" section for more backfround information and possible fixes.


[float]
[[iis-integrated-pipeline-mode]]
=== Exception: System.PlatformNotSupportedException: This operation requires IIS integrated pipeline mode

This exception happens if the classic ASP.NET application run under an Application pool that enforces the classic pipeline mode. 
This prevents our agent to modify headers and thus will break distributed tracing. 

The agent is only supported on IIS7 and higher where the `Integrated Pipeline Mode` is the default.


[float]
[[startup-hook-failure]]
=== Startup hooks failure

If the <<zero-code-change-setup, startup hook>> integration throws an exception, additional detail can be obtained by 
setting the `ELASTIC_APM_STARTUP_HOOKS_LOGGING` environment variable before starting the application

[source,sh]
----
set ELASTIC_APM_STARTUP_HOOKS_LOGGING=1
----

and then running the application in a context where the environment variable will be visible. In setting this value,
an `ElasticApmAgentStartupHook.log` file is written to the directory containing the startup hook assembly, in addition to
writing to standard output.

[float]
[[agent-overhead]]
=== The agent causes too much overhead

A good place to start is <<config-all-options-summary>>. There are multiple settings with the `Performance` keyword which can help you tweak the agent for your needs.

The most expensive operation in the agent is typically stack trace capturing. The agent, by default, only captures stack traces for spans with a duration of 5ms or more, and with a limit of 50 stack frames.
If this is too much in your environment, consider disabling stack trace capturing either partially or entirely:

- To disable stack trace capturing for spans, but continue to capture stack traces for errors, set the <<config-span-stack-trace-min-duration>> to `-1` and leave the <<config-stack-trace-limit>> on its default.
- To disable stack trace capturing entirely –which in most applications reduces the agent overhead dramatically– set <<config-stack-trace-limit>> to `0`.

[float]
[[iisexpress-classic-pipeline]]
=== The ElasticApmModule does not load or capture transactions and there are no agent logs generated on IISExpress 

When debugging applications using Visual Studio and IISExpress, the same requirement to use the `Integrated` managed 
pipeline mode exists. Select your web application project in the solution explorer and press F4 to load the properties
window. If the managed pipeline mode is set to classic, the ElasticApmModule will not load.

For example:

image::./images/classic-pipeline.png[Classic Managed Pipeline Mode in Properties]

Should be changed to:

image::./images/integrated-pipeline.png[Integrated Managed Pipeline Mode in Properties]

You may need to restart Visual Studio for these changes to fully apply.
