# Elastic.Apm.AspNetFullFramework

_NOTE: this project is work in progress and it's not yet officially released. Feel free to build it from source and experiment with it, but do not use it in production._

This project contains an IIS module that automatically starts and stops transactions for incoming HTTP requests. The goal is to provide auto instrumentation for ASP.NET (classic) applications.
