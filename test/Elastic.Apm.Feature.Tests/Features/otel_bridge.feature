  # --- Creating Elastic span or transaction from OTel span

  Scenario: Create transaction from OTel span with remote context
    Given an agent
    And OTel span is created with remote context as parent
    Then Elastic bridged object is a transaction
    Then Elastic bridged transaction has remote context as parent

  Scenario: Create root transaction from OTel span without parent
    Given an agent
    And OTel span is created without parent
    And OTel span ends
    Then Elastic bridged object is a transaction
    Then Elastic bridged transaction is a root transaction
    # outcome should not be inferred from the lack/presence of errors
    Then Elastic bridged transaction outcome is "unknown"

  Scenario: Create span from OTel span
    Given an agent
    And OTel span is created with local context as parent
    And OTel span ends
    Then Elastic bridged object is a span
    Then Elastic bridged span has local context as parent
    # outcome should not be inferred from the lack/presence of errors
    Then Elastic bridged span outcome is "unknown"

  # --- OTel span kind mapping for spans & transactions

      | unset  | unknown |
      | ok     | success |
      | error  | failure |

  Scenario Outline:  OTel span mapping with status <status> for spans
    Given an agent
